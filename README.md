# mybooklist
 Implemented using only Vanilla Javascript and HTML. No frameworks or libraries.

Simple web application for adding and listing your books.
It takes in a title, author, and an ISBN.

This application was quite interesting to implement since my basic javascript skills needed a little work. This app allowed me to hone in on those. 

Additionally, it data is not only on the UI-level but it will persist/interact with local storage.
    e.g. if you add a book and reload the page, the book will persist.
